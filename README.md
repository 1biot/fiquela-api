# FiQueLa API

**Version:** 1.0.0

FiQueLa API provides a powerful, RESTful interface for managing and querying structured file data using SQL-like syntax. Built upon the versatile FiQueLa PHP library, it seamlessly supports formats such as XML, JSON, CSV, YAML, and NEON, making it ideal for applications dealing with dynamic data imports, exports, and complex queries.
